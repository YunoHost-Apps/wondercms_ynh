This upgrade will retain files in __INSTALL_DIR__/data/, __INSTALL_DIR__/plugins/, and __INSTALL_DIR__/themes/ except for __INSTALL_DIR__/themes/sky/ which will be upgraded to the latest version. If you've altered the default php or css files in the sky theme, they will moved to /var/cache/yunohost/appconfbackup/__INSTALL_DIR__/themes/sky/
